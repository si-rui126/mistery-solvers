        Sleepers have no resistance to the veil of the Mist. They are obsessed with their own lives; they don't care what's happening around them. The Mist makes it so that Sleepers 
        just cannot see, not even what's right in front of them.

                  her for money, but she tried to turn her life around by getting a job, which was working as a receptionist at Seven Strings Studios. However, she got laid off after the events of
                <a href="cases.html#rui-1">Next Top Sacrifice</a>, so she is back to using men for their money. She is currently dating Daniel Pham.</p>
