    <p>Legendaries have chosen to not hold back but instead to revel in their Mythos. These individuals become truly powerful, channeling the fantastical qualities of their Mythos without fear or 
      doubt. Legendaries still have a persona and attachments they care about beyond the sheer agenda of their Mythos, but these are often kept secret or are sidelined because they in fact limit 
      their Mythos.</p>

          <h4>Mythos: Daedalus</h4>
          <p>Dallas is an architect contracted by Mistapolis Penitentiary. He was tasked with creating a wing of the prison strong enough to contain the warden's son, Ryan. He was motivated by 
            winning freedom for his son, Carl, who was a prisoner at the penitentiary. After many blueprints and the construction of an elaborate maze in a cavern underneath the prison, he 
            realized that he did not have what it takes to trap Ryan. He made Carl trick <a href="lenny.html">Lenny O'Connor</a> into entering Ryan's maze to distract him, while Dallas and 
            Carl made their way out. Dallas had engineered two sets of wings made from pillow feathers, gum, and his Rift magic, with which he and his son attempted to escape from the prison with. 
            Dallas's fate is currently unknown.

            also to anyone who stands in his way. He is very strong, as he is able to crash through walls with his charging move.
