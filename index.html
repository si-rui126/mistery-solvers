    <h2>What is the City of Mist?</h2>
    <p>A detective role-playing game in a city of ordinary people and legendary powers.</p>

    <p>The City of Mist appears to be a bustling metropolis to the ordinary citizen, who live through their bland, repetitive lives day to day.
      However, to those who have been blessed or cursed by forces beyond our world see the city differently.
      Tales of legendary kings and heroes, gods and monsters, take the form a Mythos, which choose their
      champions by lending certain individuals a portion of their power.
    </p>

    <h2>People of the City</h2>
    <p>The forces that lie beneath the mist affect the citizens in different ways. <a href="sleepers.html">Sleepers</a> are the ones least affected by the Mythos. They live regular ordinary lives,
     and any machinations of the Mist cannot even be processed by their minds.</p>
    <p>Once a Mythos starts the take hold of a person, they become known as a Rift. There are different degrees to which a Rift is affected by the Mist. <a href="borderlines.html">Borderliners</a>
     are caught in between their normal life and the pull of their Mythos. Rifts who fully embrace their Mythos are known as <a href="legendaries.html">Legendaries</a>. Legendaries are very
    powerful Rifts who are almost a reincarnation of their mythological counterparts. They have given up their ordinary lives to become extraordinary.</p>
