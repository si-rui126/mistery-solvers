            <h2>Description</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>August is a slim young man with medium brown hair and hazel eyes.
                He spends most of his time in the labs at the Museum of Art and History, where he works on the back end of the museum maintaining the integrity of the pieces of art and cleaning and 
                making sure they are well kept. </p>
            <p>August dresses nicely, his work doesnt require him to be formal. He has lots of linen and cotton collared shirts, he is big on sweaters. He loves nice shoes and has a collection 
                of oxfords and also a collection of weird ties but he doesn't wear ties that often; he mainly just likes to collect them.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                August was born into a wealthy family and from a young age he had lots of expectations put upon him. Growing up he was never really
                 allowed to explore his real passions. As he fought back against his fathers expectations and iron grip on his life, their 
                 relationship grew more and more tense until August moved out and distanced himself from his family. The only reason he didn’t 
                 completely cut himself off from his family was that Liam and Lily were still there and he didn't want to lose his connection with 
                 them. He holds disdain for both his mother and father, regarding his parents both as selfish and unloving, only having a family 
                 because that is what society expected of them and never really devoting any proper attention to their children. 
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <h2>Personality</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>August usually trys to put on a polite and compossed front most of the time but there are times where he will show more of his 
                real personality, eg. when drunk or if he is comfortable enough with the people around him. At the core of it he is still somewhat 
                childish and impulsive, he likes to follow his gut and doesn't always communicate very well with others and does things independantly. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He's also a romantic at heart and loves everything gossip and romance.
            </p>
            <br>
        
            <h2>Relationships</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Evan Knight</h3>
            <p>August was romantically involved with Evan Knight during his time in college but nothing ever came of it and they never had a defined label. Evan moved away for a job</p>
            <h3>Sarah Snyder</h3>
            <p>His coworker, Sarah Snyder, really annoys him. She always complains about her boyfriend and initially august tried to comfort her and listen to her but she is such a push over 
                and always says she is going to break up with him but never does and its already been a year since he has had to listen to her complaints</p>
            <br>
        
            <h2>Abilities</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>Shape the Wind</h3>
            <p> 
            August is able to shape and control the wind. This ability lets him create anything as minor as a gentle breeze to anything as violent as a tornado. Though if he gets emotionally 
            unstable and out of control his winds will follow suit and create a ruthless hurricane with no regard for his or his companions saftey. 
            </p>
            <h3><a href="https://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/ability/wind-wall-646">Wind Barrier</a></h3>
            <p>Using his ability to control the wind he can create a barrier of various cross winds that will repel anything as big as a large creature.</p>
            <h3>Faster than the Wind</h3>
            <p>August is able to run at high speeds, he gets even faster when he turns into wind. </p>
            <h3>Turn into Wind</h3>
            <p>He is able to turn into wind which entails turning invisible, being able to squeeze through tight spaces, and traveling in non conventional ways. </p>
            <br>
