            <p>Amelia never needed anyone in her life. After all, she's the most feared con-woman on this side of the river. With her wits, beauty, and intellect, no heist has posed a 
                challenge for her in a long time. However, her boring life gets turned upside down when she crosses paths with Lennathan "Lenny" Liandry, a retired FBI agent now working for a 
                mysterious organization. They have to work together to pull off the greatest heist of all time. But will Lenny make off with just the loot? Or will he capture Amelia's heart as 
                well?</p>

            <p>The tall handsome man clad in a striped emerald suit caressed my cheeks, which glistened with crystal dew that had trickled from the corner of my eyes. I cried out,  
                “Please Lenny, let me be the distraction… it's too dangerous for you to go in alone.“ </p>
            <p>His lips parted for a mere second as if he wanted to say something, but then quickly pressed them back into a thin line. Lenny place his hand on top of my head, and then ruffled 
                my sleek long raven black locks. “Don't worry about me, you know I am special too.”</p>
                <p>I was no longer crying. This form made me feel more confident in myself, for good reason too. My jaws parted, “Lenny, I'll help distract the guards. You just focus on 
                    getting the goods” His strong beautiful hands tried to reach out and grab me by my scruff, but i was faster. I scampered off to where we had planned the heist. The mission 
                    starts now.</p>
            <p>The plan was that Lenny would walk straight through the  front doors and request access to the vault. Using his trickery, he would convince the tellers to give him $5,000 in 
                cash. However, since his powers only works on small groups of people at a time, The guards would eventually notice, if they were paying attention.</p>

                    <p>My all time favorite Amy Fujiwara book. My copy is so battered from me taking it around the country with me, but it's so good to reread since the action is exciting every 
                        time. My favorite part is when Lenny stayed behind in the National Treasury so Amy could escape.</p>

            <p>Dive into a fantastical world of paper and books with 17-year old [Y/N]. [Y/N] was just a normal high schooler, until she came across a book that was not like the others at her 
                local library. When she opened the book, she fell into a mystical world inside the pages, ruled by the Imp Prince Azrik. Now she has to nagivate her new life inside 
                the magical book. Will she be able to make it home, or will she fall for the handsome prince?</p>

        <div class="review-content">
            <p>Once upon a time, there was a mystical library hidden from the world of humans. In this library lived a young and handsome prince of the imps. He had paper white hair and a 
                jawline sharp enough to give papercuts. Two long horns extended from the top of his head, and he was a fearsome sight to behold. Lounging on his throne of books, the imp looked 
                up to the ceiling. Each day felt the same, and there was not a single living being in this realm other than the paper imps. The prince sighed… if only something interesting would happen. 
                Suddenly, the ceiling started to shimmer and looked as if it had turned into liquid. A young woman with beautiful [H/C] locks fell from above. She landed on a library table 
                with a loud thud, and let out a small yelp.                 
                “Oww… that hurt. Where am I?”</p>
            <p>The woman looked around, and her eyes landed on the handsome imp in front of her. “Oh hello there, do you know how to get out of here?” she asked in a cautious voice.
                The imp rose from his seat, and made his way towards the woman. In a noble voice, he said, “Of course I know, but why should I tell you?” Upon closer look this imp prince was 
                devilishly handsome. His delicate pale lips parted and he asked, “What's your name, young one?”                
                The woman shuffled her feet uncomfortably and responded, “My name is [Y/N]..” He gazed at her with a mysterious look in his eyes, and he whispered “That's a beautiful name. 
                Mine is Azrik, and I'm the ruler of this place.”</p>
            <p>The two of them conversed in the stillness of the library, surrounded by endless walls of books. [Y/N] explained that she had touched a magical book in her world, and that her 
                friends are still waiting for her on the other side. Azrik tilted his head as she spoke, his pointy ears perked up in interest as [Y/N] told him of their fantastic adventures 
                before she had been sucked into this dimension. The way the dust glimmered around [Y/N] as her pretty pink lips opened and closed as she gestured with her hands. Unfortunately, 
                Azrik still was not convinced that he should allow this woman to leave. Since she had seen the secret side of this library, it would be a liability if she were to leave. Azrik 
                hummed as he closed his eyes. The next few days will be fun...</p>

                    <p>This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination. HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS. And this one is not even the best of her works. 
                        As I always say about Fujiwara's books, the characters are the ones who make the action. It's like they are the very engine of a plot.
