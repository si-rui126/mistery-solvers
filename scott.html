          <h2>Description</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Scott is a short young man with greasy black hair that falls on the right side of his face. He loves to wear hoodie blazers, basketball shorts, and sneakers. Since he spends most 
            of his time tinkering in his home-workshop, he is usually covered in some sort of machine grease or energy drink stain. When he isn’t working on his projects, he likes to play 
            Krunker Strike at the arcade or record songs for his mixtape.</p>
          <br>
      
          <h2>History</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>Scott is the older of two brothers. His parents moved to a nice suburban neighborhood with high expectations for both children. He had a competitive past with his brother: 
            academically, athletically, musically, socially etc. Scott truly peaked in high school, with many achievements and popularity among his peers. However, in the middle of his 
            university studies, he was overcome with a sudden inspiration and he knew his calling was to be a great inventor. He dropped out of his mechanical engineering degree to become 
            a freelance inventor. His parents do not support him, but allow him to live in their basement. Since Scott has yet to see much success, he often has to take on odd jobs to 
            fund his materials. Meanwhile, his younger brother, Talbot, graduated from university and founded Helix Labs. Due to his growing success, Talbot has agreed to sponsor Scott's 
            inventing endeavors so Scott is now focusing on inventing full time.</p>
          <br>
      
          <h2>Personality</h2>

          <h2>Relationships</h2>
          <hr>
            <h3><a href="sleepers.html#vivian-tran">Vivian Tran</a></h3>
              <p>Somehow Scott managed to pull a baddie like Vivian and they dated for two years. Vivian was initially drawn to Scott's claims of “building a start-up and getting rich” and 
                stayed around because he made her laugh sometimes. However, after two years, Scott was seeing little progress in his inventions, and Vivian didn't want to date someone who 
                still lived in his parents' basement and didn't own a car. She broke up with him, leaving him in shambles. Scott became an alcoholic after the breakup, and is still trying 
                to win her back.

              </p>
          <br>
      
          <h2>Abilities</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>Breath of Life</h3>
          <p>Scott can give sentience to anything he has worked on. The amount of effort and time he spends, as well as the quality of his materials determines how effective the creation is.</p>
          <h3>Project L</h3>
          <p> Project L is Scott's self-proclaimed "magnum opus". Project L, dubbed Liona, is a human sized automaton with enhanced strength and speed.
            Liona started off as an android helper for people with dehabilitating illnesses with every day tasks. However, Scott got carried away and kept adding useless modifications to her,
            such as a flamethrower, laser eyes, and a fountain drink dispenser inside her torso. With all the mods, it is hard to Liona to perform any task effciently, but she still retains
            some of the caring and nuturing tendencies from her original programming.
            Liona can also deploy AOE shockwaves, and her palms are also defibrillators.
            She spends most of her time in a capsule inside Scott's basement, but she can be launched to Scott's current location when summoned. Because of the
            landing impact, Liona must be repaired for a long time after each use.
          </p>
          <h3>Proficient Mechanic</h3>
          <p>            Scott is knowledgable in mechanical engineering, to aid with his interest in robotics. He was able to fix up a car from a junkyard, as well as
            completely restoring the paint job of a scratched car in under 20 minutes.
